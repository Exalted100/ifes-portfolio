            <h3>THE BRIEF</h3>
            <p>Examinrr is an app that was created as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, to enable Nigerian universities conduct online examinations from their homes. The goals include:</p>
            <ul className="list-container">
                <li>Allowing universities conduct examinations; grade and publish results for their students, while obeying the Covid-19 protocols</li>
                <li>Providing an easy way to ensure that students continue with their educational process</li>
                <li>Enabling students take examinations from the comfort of their homes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>Working on this design was easier than the first because I was way more familiar with Figma. It was also exciting working with other designers. I was able to admire and learn from the creative thinking of others, as well as broaden my knowledge on the use of Figma. It also helped me with teamwork, and Iâ€™m genuinely grateful for that opportunity, as well as satisfied with the solutions we came up with for this design.</p>
