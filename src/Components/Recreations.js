            <h2>MY RECREATIONS</h2>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy recreating fun and challenging designs found online. By doing this, I have learnt a lot more about glassmorphism, neumorphism, 3D designs, website UI, Mobile app UI, as well as how to combine colors for certain websites. Here are some of the designs I have recreated.  Click images for full view.</p>
