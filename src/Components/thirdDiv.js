                <p>At the start of my journey as a UI/UX designer, I interned with Zuri International, where  I designed an online donation application. I also worked with a team of designers, front end and back end developers to build an online examination app.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I redesign and recreate websites and apps found online, in order to get constructive comments and improve on myself.</p>
